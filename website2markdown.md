## Process Section: How It Works

### 01 Cryptographic Attribution
**Description:** Assign immutable identities to every non-human actor. Our protocol ensures every API call, data access, and decision is signed and tied to a verified model version and human owner.
**Focus:** Identity & Ownership

### 02 Intent Observability
**Description:** Capture the 'Why' behind the 'What.' We log the internal reasoning and chain-of-thought of your agents, turning black-box hallucinations into searchable, forensic data.
**Focus:** Traceability

### 03 Automated Compliance
**Description:** Turn your agent logs into an asset. Automatically generate audit-ready reports for SOC2, the EU AI Act, and internal legal reviews. Verify that your agents are following policy—even when you aren't watching.
**Focus:** Accountability
